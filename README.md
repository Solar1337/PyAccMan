# PyAccMan
PyAccMan (or "Python Account Manager") is a compact and simple program that allows the user to create an account and log in to the account afterwords.
The Program will also allow the user to Manage the account (Change Password/Username, Delete Account etc.).
Please note that this program is still WIP and currently at a very early stage of development.
